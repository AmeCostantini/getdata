##Goals
This document aims to explain how the code run_analysis.R was written and why I made my choices in performing the analysis.

##Overview
The run_analysis.R was created in order to create a tidy dataset according to te requirements of the coursera **Getting and Cleaning Data** course.

##Structure
The script is splitted into 7 chunks. Each one perform a critical step in the analysis devoted to the creation of the new dataset. Now I am going to describe each single step. You can relate them with the ones in the script looking at comments.

###Step 0: setting the working directories and downloading the files



###Step 1: Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set



###Step 2: properly naming variables



###Step 3: Decoding activities information



###Step 4: Etracting only measurement on mean and standard deviation




###Step 5: Calculating mean for this variables grouping by activity and subject




###Step 6: write.table
